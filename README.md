# My Dotfiles
These are my Linux dotfiles. I'm using [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) as a management/installation tool.

## Minimum Requirements
I included everything I'd need in here to set myself up on another machine, but you'll at least need the following packages:
### Shell
  - zsh
### X
  - i3wm
  - Polybar

## Installation
Clone this repo, `cd` into it and run:
```
$ ./install
$ systemctl enable --now mpd.service
```
